ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on strengthening information management at UNHCR Guatemala. I hope to expand a culture of evidence-based decision-making to ensure the greatest impact on the lives of forcibly displaced populations.
ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate with other people working to improve humanitarian data analysis and/or building composite indicators to target the most vulnerable populations.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to work with GitHub and starting with R.
âš¡ Fun fact: I used to be a social educator in a previous life.
